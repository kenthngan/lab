# ECMA6

The newest version of JavaScript has already been defined and agreed. Known as **Harmony** or **ECMA6**, it includes a number of powerful changes that make programming simpler and less error-prone. Unfortunately as of 2015 most of the features are not supported by the current browsers.

Your challenge is to learn about the most important features of ECMA6, identify which of these are currently supported and finally to try out the supported features.

## 1 ECMA6 Features

Start by investigating the following ECMA features. as you read about them try and relate this to what you already understand about JavaScript programming:

- [Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)
- [Object.observe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe)
- [Arrow Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- [Constants](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
- [Block Scoping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
- [Rest Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [Destructuring Assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

## 2 Browser Support

Different browsers have different levels of support for the new ECMA6 features. Helpfully there are a number of useful up-to-date resources that can help you decide which features to implement. There are a number of [compatibility tables](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) and in addition the major browsers such as [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla) and [Chrome](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/wiki/ES6-%28a.k.a.-Harmony%29-Features-Implemented-in-V8-and-Available-in-Node) also provide this information.

Use a range of online resources to determine which of the features listed above are supported by the **Chrome** browser.

## 3 Using the Supported Features

Finally, try to write simple JavaScript apps that demonstrate each of the Supported features.
