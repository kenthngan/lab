# Automated Testing

This topic covers the concepts of automated testing and how it can be used to improve the quality of your code.

1. the **01 Unit Testing** worksheet shows you how to write automated tests for your _NodeJS Modules_, allowing you to thoroughly test them before integrating them into your API. It covers both synchronous and asynchronous testing as well as the use of _code coverage tests_ to ensure that all code paths are being covered.
2. in **02 Acceptance Testing** you will extend your tests to cover the API interface and ensure that it works correctly. You should apply acceptance tests in your assignment to gain the higher grades.
