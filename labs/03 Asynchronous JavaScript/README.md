# Asynchronous JavaScript

In this third topic we will be understanding how to handle long-running tasks by spawning new threads and using callbacks that run when the activity has completed.

1. the worksheet **01 AJAX** is considered essential and covers the use of the XMLHTTPRequest object to make both synchronous and asynchronous http requests. It also covers the use of JSON data including how to convert to and from JavaScript objects.
2. the worksheet **02 Promises** covers the use of promises to chain asynchronous events together. This is considered *intermediate* skills.

This is the third, and last, topic covering basic JavaScript. Starting next week you will be learning how to write server-side JavaScript using NodeJS. Make sure you are comfortable with the materials from the first two weeks before starting the worksheets.
