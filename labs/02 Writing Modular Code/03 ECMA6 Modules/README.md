# ECMA6 Modules

Currently there is no built-in module system for JavaScript however this has been implemented in the latest proposals (ECMA6). Unfortunately these proposals have not been implemented in any of the current generation of browsers. If you want to implement these modules you will need to make use of a third-party shim/plugin.

For your advanced challenge you will be required to use the **require-hm** plugin that works with **RequireJS** to enable **ECMA6 Modules** to be used. You will need to read around the subject however the following resources will get you started:

## 2 Classes

ECMA6 also introduces [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to JavaScript for the first time. This is a simpler way to implement object prototypes.
