# Modular JavaScript

In this second topic you will be extending your knowledge of the JavaScript language by learning how to break your programs into self-contained **modules**.

1. the worksheet **01 Closures** is considered *core knowledge* and introduces you to the use of closures and IIFEs to encapsulate data and functionality.
2. the worksheet **02 Modules** contains the intermediate skills which cover some important concepts such as *object prototypes* and the use of *module loaders*.
3. in the final worksheet **03 ECMA6 Modules** you will learn about how native modules will be implemented in the next generation of JavaScript and will be shown how to use these using a third party library.

Before starting this topic you should make sure you have completed topic 1 and fully understand the materials it presents. Remember you are expected to spend **18 hours per week** working on these materials and reading around the topics covered. Make sure you don't start falling behind and ask for help if you need it.
