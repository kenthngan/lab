# Topic Worksheets

Welcome to the first topic. This is divided up into several worksheets and is aimed at getting you up to speed with the basic JavaScript programming language.

The weekly worksheets have been carefully graded:

1. the worksheet **01 Tools** is considered *core knowledge* and needs to be understood if you are to pass the module.
2. the worksheet **02 Language** contains the intermediate skills and knowledge to boost your understanding and grade.
3. the **03 ECMA6** worksheet introduces a number of new features that form the ECMA6 update. You should learn about these if you are to get the highest grade.

You should be attending at least two practical lab sessions per week but you may, if you wish, attend more.
