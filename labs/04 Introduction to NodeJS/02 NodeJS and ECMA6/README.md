# NodeJS ECMA6 Support

Before you start this or any other worksheet you should make sure you have the latest commits from the upstream repository on **GitHub**.
```
git pull upstream master
```
You should also make sure you are running the latest version of NodeJS. Instructions on how to check this and upgrade the installation are in topic 4.

NodeJS is based on the latest Chrome V8 runtime and, as such, already supports many important ECMA6 features. In thiw worksheet you will be exploring several of these and seeing how they will help you write clearer, more robust code.

## 1 Promises Revisited

You have already learned about **promises** in topic 3 and they will be invaluable when you start building non-trivial APIs. They allow you to avoid deep nested callbacks (callback hell) and simplify error handling. For this reason we will revisit them and introduce a new _arrow_ function syntax which cleans up your anonymous function definitions.

If any promise in the chain gets rejected the entire chain fails and control is passed to the `catch()` method. This simplifies the error handling.

Open the `promises.js` file and study the code carefully.

1. compare the two functions at the top of the script. They share a very similar structure, returning a **Promise** object containing an anonymous function. The function takes two function parameters and calls the `resolve()` function.
2. notice that the syntax is different, one uses the standard anonymous function declaration that you are familair with. The second uses the new ECMA6 _arrow_ function syntax. Understand the differences.
3. also notice that the result of the calculations are stored in a **constant** rather than a variable. ECMA6 defines a [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) keyword which means that the variable _identifier_ can't be re-assigned a different value later in the script. This helps prevent some bugs being introduced into the code. You should always use _const_ it the value should not change.
4. the second function implements a variable with _block_ scope rather then _function_ scope. This uses the [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) keyword instead if _var_.
5. there are four functions, each implementing the same promise chain but using different syntax. Compare these to make sure you understand how they were constructed.
6. run the script and enter a string, press enter when done. Make sure you understand the program flow.
7. uncomment the reject function call in the first function and run the script again, what happens?
8. uncomment the reject function call in the second, how does this affect the execution?
9. what happens if the first promise resolves and the second rejects?

### 1.1 Test Your Knowledge

1. rewrite the first function using the _arrow function_ syntax. Make sure it still works.
2. write another function that capitalises the last letter in the string using the _arrow function_ syntax.
3. finally add this third function to each of the four promise chains.
4. how could you achieve the same result without needing a third function (hint: you can add the same promise multiple times).
5.
